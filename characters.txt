Tom brings Nick to the Valley of Ashes, an industrial dumping
 site between West Egg and the city, and picks up his mistress 
 Myrtle Wilson at a garage owned by her husband George. One 
 day, Nick receives an invitation to one of Catsby's parties. 
 There, Nick encounters Jordan and they both meet Catsby.


 -Catsby takes Nick to Manhattan for lunch, telling Nick on the 
 way that he is an Oxford graduate and war hero from a wealthy 
 Midwestern family. They go to a speakeasy, where Catsby 
 introduces Nick to his business partner Meyer Wolfsheim.

 Jordan tells Nick how Catsby, a Captain of the U.S. Army, started
a relationship with Daisy in 1917 before the U.S. entered World
War I, and is still in love with her; he throws parties hoping 
that Daisy might attend. Catsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to 
 tea. After an awkward reunion, Catsby and Daisy begin an affair.
Catsby is dismayed when Daisy wants to run away with him, 
preferring that she get a proper divorce. He asks Nick and Jordan
to accompany him to the Buchanan home, where he and Daisy plan
to tell Tom that Daisy is leaving him. During the luncheon,
 Tom becomes suspicious of Catsby and Daisy, but Daisy stops
Catsby from revealing anything to Tom and suggests they
 all go to the Plaza Hotel. Tom drives Nick and Jordan in Catsby's
car while Catsby drives Daisy in Tom's car. Tom stops for gas at
 George's garage, where George tells him that he and Myrtle are 
 moving and that he suspects Myrtle is unfaithful.

that killed Myrtle, and then kills himself.[
