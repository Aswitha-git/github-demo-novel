Tom brings Nick to the Valley of Ashes, an industrial dumping
 site between West Egg and the city, and picks up his mistress 
 Myrtle Wilson at a garage owned by her husband George. One 
 day, Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties. 
 There, Nick encounters Jordan and they both meet Gatsby.


 -Gatsby takes Nick to Manhattan for lunch, telling Nick on the 
 way that he is an Oxford graduate and war hero from a wealthy 
 Midwestern family. They go to a speakeasy, where Gatsby 
 introduces Nick to his business partner Meyer Wolfsheim.

 Jordan tells Nick how Gatsby, a Captain of the U.S. Army, started
a relationship with Daisy in 1917 before the U.S. entered World
War I, and is still in love with her; he throws parties hoping 
that Daisy might attend. Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to 
 tea. After an awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair.
Gatsby is dismayed when Daisy wants to run away with him, 
preferring that she get a proper divorce. He asks Nick and Jordan
to accompany him to the Buchanan home, where he and Daisy plan
to tell Tom that Daisy is leaving him. During the luncheon,
 Tom becomes suspicious of Gatsby and Daisy, but Daisy stops
Gatsby from revealing anything to Tom and suggests they
 all go to the Plaza Hotel. Tom drives Nick and Jordan in Gatsby's
car while Gatsby drives Daisy in Tom's car. Tom stops for gas at
 George's garage, where George tells him that he and Myrtle are 
 moving and that he suspects Myrtle is unfaithful.
