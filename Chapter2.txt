n November 15, Luhrmann announced that Carey Mulligan had 
been cast to play Daisy after reading for the part on Novembe
r 2 in New York.[20] Mulligan won the role shortly after
Luhrmann showed her audition footage to Sony Pictures 
Entertainment executives Amy Pascal and Doug Belgrad, 
who were impressed by the actress' command of the character.[20] 
Mulligan burst into tears after learning of her casting 
via a phone call from Luhrmann, who informed her of his 
decision while she was on the red carpet at an event in 
New York. Luhrmann said: "I was privileged to explore the 
character with some of the world's most talented actresses, 
each one bringing their own particular interpretation, 
all of which were legitimate and exciting. However, 
specific to this particular production of The Great Gatsby, 
I was thrilled to pick up the phone an hour ago to the 
young Oscar-nominated British actress Carey Mulligan and 
say to her: 'Hello, Daisy Buchanan.'
