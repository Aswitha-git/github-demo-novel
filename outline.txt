Tom brings Nick to the Valley of Ashes, an industrial dumping site between West Egg and the city,
 and picks up his mistress Myrtle Wilson at a garage owned by her husband George. One day, Nick 
 receives an invitation to one of Catsby's parties. There, Nick encounters Jordan and they both 
 meet Catsby. Catsby takes Nick to Manhattan for lunch, telling Nick on the way that he is an 
 Oxford graduate and war hero from a wealthy Midwestern family. They go to a speakeasy, where 
 Catsby introduces Nick to his business partner Meyer Wolfsheim.
