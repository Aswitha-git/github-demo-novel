Inside the mansion, Gatsby tells Nick the truth: that 
he was born penniless, his real name is James Gatz, and 
he had asked Daisy to wait for him until he had made 
something of himself after the war; instead, she married
Tom seven months after the war ended. The next day, 
Nick goes back to work and Gatsby awaits a call from
Daisy while swimming in his pool. The phone rings, and
Gatsby's butler answers it. Believing the caller to 
be Daisy, Gatsby is shot and killed by a vengeful 
George, who then commits suicide. Nick, who was the
one calling, hears the gunshots and is the only
person other than reporters to attend Gatsby's
funeral as Daisy, Tom, and their daughter are 
leaving New York. The media falsely and negatively paints
Gatsby as Myrtle's lover and killer, enraging Nick.
Disgusted with both the city and its inhabitants, Nick 
leaves after taking a final walk-through Gatsby's
deserted mansion and reflecting on Gatsby's ability to hope.
 
Chapter 2
On November 15, Luhrmann announced that Carey Mulligan had 
been cast to play Daisy after reading for the part on Novembe
r 2 in New York.[20] Mulligan won the role shortly after
Luhrmann showed her audition footage to Sony Pictures 
Entertainment executives Amy Pascal and Doug Belgrad, 
who were impressed by the actress' command of the character.[20] 
Mulligan burst into tears after learning of her casting 
via a phone call from Luhrmann, who informed her of his 
decision while she was on the red carpet at an event in 
New York. Luhrmann said: "I was privileged to explore the 
character with some of the world's most talented actresses, 
each one bringing their own particular interpretation, 
all of which were legitimate and exciting. However, 
specific to this particular production of The Great Gatsby, 
I was thrilled to pick up the phone an hour ago to the 
young Oscar-nominated British actress Carey Mulligan and 
say to her: 'Hello, Daisy Buchanan.'
